                        Two teams compete with each other to guess as many famous persons during the game as they can.

                        First each player submits secretly a few names to the game that the other players probably also
                        know. Once 30 names are gathered, the competition begins. One player from the first team has 60
                        seconds to explain the names drawn one after the other to their teammates. If the teammates find
                        out the person, the team scores a point and the player goes on with explaining the next person.
                        The teammates can guess as many times as they want. After 60 seconds it is the other team's
                        turn. The two teams continue like this until all names are explained (the players within the
                        teams take turns in explaining after each 60-second slot). In the second round the player is
                        only allowed to say one word, which will help their teammates to guess the person. In the third
                        round the player on turn can only pantomime without saying a word. After the three rounds the
                        team with higher scores wins.

                        It is upon agreement if only real life persons or also fictious characters can be guessed in the
                        game. For advanced level you can agree on a limited topic (e.g. only artists) or concepts
                        instead of persons.{" "}
